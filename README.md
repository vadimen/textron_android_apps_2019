# textron_android_apps_2019
These are the android apps I did on the course offered by Textron Fleet Management from Pitesti in 2019

It was a one semester class at the university of Pitesti. We did projects in the class and then we had homework. By the end of it I got employed by Textron Fleet Management in Pitesti
and worked there for 1.5 years. Had a great time with the job and colleagues. Uploading it at the end of 2023 cause didn't have a habit of using github back then.
